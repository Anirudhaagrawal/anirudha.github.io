[Shavak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shavaka/) and I had been planning to meet all winter. But him being in Vancouver without a US visa and me being in New York without a Canadian visa didn't help at all. A week before New Years, he calls me up. "Bro, let's go to Mexico?" he asked. You see, that wasn't an issue because Mexico doesn't require any additional visa if you already have a valid US or Canadian visa. Me being me, without thinking too much, I answered "Sure, let's go!". And that's where the fun ended. Neither of us had never been to an international vacation before. So in the two weeks before our departure, we had to plan *everything*. 

Now that we're back from our trip, in hindsight, it feels like we managed to accomplish a lot given our constraints. So to save you from all the trouble that we had to go through, here's a documentation of the logistics of our trip. Our trip was centred around two primary pillars: a *roadtrip*, because I love them; and *food*, because that's Shavak's forte.

# Itinerary

Going through the interwebz, we decided to explore the Yucatan peninsula. This was the ðŸ§­ [triangular route](https://goo.gl/maps/YGdUxtVmbUXPq1fDA) that we were going to take. Starting from Cancun, we would visit the quaint little town of Valladolid, followed by the ancient ruins of Chichen Itza, before finally arriving at Merida. We would also visit the beach town of Progreso before heading over to Bacalar in the southern part of the peninsula. From there, we'd head over to the more touristy cities of Tulum and Playa del Carmen before heading back to Cancun. During our stay in Playa, we'd also visit the nearby island of Cozumel. Complete with beaches, ancient Mayan ruins, cenotes, lagoons, and of course, food from all over the peninsula -- this journey of over a 1000 kms should be amazing!

# Planning

Before flying to Cancun, three were a few things we needed to take care of.

**Flights**: This is very subjective depending on where you fly from. If you're taking a budget carrier, make sure to check out their baggage allowances. As I've mentioned before, you don't need a mexican visa if you already have an active US or a Canadian visa. More info can be found on the ðŸŒŽ [official website](https://consulmex.sre.gob.mx/washington/index.php/servicios-para-extranjeros-visas?id=182) of the Mexican Embassy.

**Travel Insurance**: This is another decision that we leave up to you. Make sure you check the fine print, though. If your country issues a travel advisory, you might not be covered. If you're considering taking one, make sure COVID related situations are covered as well.

**COVID Tests**: At the time of writing this blog, Mexico didn't have any additional vaccine requirements. However, the US and Canada had separate testing requirements to enter. There are COVID testing centres easily available in Cancun and Playa del Carmen, so you shouldn't worry about it. We got our tests done from ðŸ§­ [PlayaLab](https://g.page/PLAYALAB?share) right next to the pier in Playa del Carmen because of the location, reviews and prices.

**Travel Cards**: Credit cards are accepted in Mexico, but many places will add an additional surcharge. Some smaller merchants might not accept American Express, so carrying a Visa or a MasterCard is recommended. Make sure to check the foreign currency markup on your card - it's best if your card doesn't have one, or if the reward rate makes up for it. To withdraw cash, you can either use a forex card, or a debit card. Just make sure you withdraw from a bank's ATM. I remember seeing a charge of 50 MXN per withdrawal, so it's best if you keep the number of ATM visits to a minimum.

**Mobile Internet**: You can buy a local TelCel SIM card as soon as you arrive in Mexico. Or if you're using T-Mobile like me, just talk to them about the Mexico and Canada add-on. For 5 USD, you can get free calls to Canada and Mexico with 4GB of high speed data.

**Things to pack**: Mexico was very pleasant in January when we visited. However, do check the forecast for difficult weather conditions. Apart from other personal belongings, we'd recommend keeping a *cenote bag* that you could use while diving in the water. This is basically a wet bag with some beachwear, footwear, sunscreen, sunglasses, and a towel. If you can get a snorkel or a GoPro, that would be great too. We would also advise you to keep some spare US Dollars that would be handy if you run out of Mexican Pesos.

**Car Rental**: We chose ðŸ§­ [Yes Rent a Car](https://g.page/yescarcancun?share) because of their reviews and the price they were offering. They were kind enough to offer free pick-up and drop-off services to and from Cancun Airport. If you message them on WhatsApp, you can also ask for a better price than the one quoted on their ðŸŒŽ [website](https://yesrentacar.com.mx/english/). An automatic sedan for 9 days cost us 522 USD. The price also included a zero deductible plan. We were also lucky enough to get an upgrade from an Aveo to a Jetta for free. Overall, definitely recommended.

**Car Rental Caveats**: There are a few things to keep in mind though. **One**, it is mandatory to take a Third Party Insurance (TPI) in Mexico. In most cases this will already be included **Two**, most car rental insurances that are bundled with US credit card are not valid in Mexico. **Three**, some websites might quote really cheap prices (like 3-4 USD per day) for the car but as soon as you go to the checkout page you'll see a hefty insurance charge. **Four**, beware of car rental scams happening around the airport. It's better if you book a car in advance and have the rental company escort you from the airport itself. For these reasons, we took the all inclusive package with a zero deductible, all insurances included.

### Accomodation
We booked a budget accomodation for every city except Playa del Carmen. You could either book a regular hotel room, or a BnB. We preferred the latter. You can also consider hostel accomodation - plenty of which you can find on ðŸŒŽ [hostelworld.com](https://www.hostelworld.com/). Here's what we considered while booking accomodations for every city: 

**Valladolid** is a small town, most of which is centred around the ðŸ§­ [Parque Principal](https://goo.gl/maps/rziCv4Bzdri8YNcd6). It's great if you could find accomodation close to the park. That way, you can easily walk down ðŸ§­ [Calzada de Los Frailes](https://goo.gl/maps/7JPapMbi1BB3XX4c9), which ends in the historic ðŸ§­ [Convent of San Bernardino](https://goo.gl/maps/sSBtTJ5FyxuG6AB36).  
**Merida** is a large city, but we wanted to explore its historic center. So we looked for a place close to ðŸ§­ [Plaza Grande](https://goo.gl/maps/b4SSGS6wPtgC1u1j7). We also saw a few hostels nearby, which might be worth a shot.  
**Bacalar** is a small town by the lake. Although we booked a place 18kms away from the town at the end of the lagoon, we would suggest you find a place in the ðŸ§­ [town](https://goo.gl/maps/21HYHucGefCp5cvn8) itself.  
**Tulum** has two parts: one is the ðŸ§­ [city centre](https://goo.gl/maps/7NP1KWt5ScddwLVv5), and the other is the ðŸ§­ [hotel zone](https://goo.gl/maps/BM6EWxMKQvEoie6U9). Most tourists stay in the hotel zone, but we avoided it because the resorts over there were prohibitively expensive. If you can find a good deal, go for it. We, however, stayed close to the city centre, which also gave us access to the local street food market.  
**Playa del Carmen**'s touristy promenade is the Fifth Avenue, or ðŸ§­ [Quinta Avenida](https://goo.gl/maps/o6SKeXkUPh8XPWyy6). If you stay around this area, everything from restaurants to shopping malls will be accessible by foot. We stayed at ðŸ§­ [Hotel Colibri Beach](https://g.page/hotelcolibribeach?share), and the location couldn't have been any better.

Once you are done with flight, car and hotel bookings, you're all set. Mexico, here I come! 

# The Trip
Here's how the actual trip turned out to be. We did a lot of improvisations here and there, but in the end, we were really happy with what we could achieve.

## Day 0: Cancun
Arrive at Cancun, where you can use the Airport's Wi-Fi to contact the car representative. Get your car, and head over to the nearest Oxxo to get a SIM card if you want. You can then head over to ðŸ§­ [Ninfa's Cafe](https://goo.gl/maps/iXzmBeGiXGVgR9TM8) to fill your belly. This cute little cafe is famous for its Oaxacan cuisine. The host, Ninfa, is also very welcoming.

{{<figure src="https://i.imgur.com/Fb6HgRM.jpg" caption="Oaxacan food at Ninfa's Cafe.">}}


Next, drive towards Valladolid. You can either take the ðŸ§­ [toll road](https://goo.gl/maps/eotksjis6Mk1Q48o7) or the ðŸ§­ [free road](https://goo.gl/maps/N5hmhzwJGRt2GWXi6). The toll is 338 MXN for a car. We took the toll road, but I guess the other road wouldn't have been a bad idea either. Be aware that Valladolid follows the central time zone whereas Cancun follows EST, so you will *save* an hour during the journey. You can use this time to check-in, freshen up, and explore the local market that Valladolid has to offer. 

## Day 0: Valladolid

Visit Calzada de Los Frailes, which is a street surrounded by pretty restaurants. You can try marquesitas and elotes near the ðŸ§­ [historic church](https://goo.gl/maps/nwqJTp4gyVcoshPB7), and buy mayan alcohol on your way back. We got XtabentÃºn, which is a sweet, traditional liquor made with anise seeds.

{{<figure src="https://i.imgur.com/bVLXGih.jpg" caption="The Valladolid sign with ðŸ§­ [Convento de San Bernardino de Siena](https://goo.gl/maps/XhcLf5a3cucfHhJC6) in the background.">}}

For dinner, you can have traditional mayan cuisine at ðŸ§­ [Ix Cat Ik](https://g.page/iixcatik?share), or have tamales at ðŸ§­ [La Palapita de los Tamales](https://g.page/palapitadelostamales?share). This is the first place where I tried the classic chaya juice with lemon, which I absolutely fell in love with. Post dinner, you can have a taste of the alcohol that you bought, and prepare for the next day where we visit Chichen Itza.

## Day 1: Chichen Itza
Get up early, have breakfast, and make sure to visit Chichen Itza before 11am -- which is when tourist buses start crowding up. The entry fee is 533 MXN, which includes two types of fees -- a federal fee of 400 MXN, which you can pay by card, and a state fee of 83 MXN, which you can only pay by cash. At the ticket counter, you could also hire a guide if you like. Exploring the ancient mayan ruins takes about 2-3 hours. The main attraction is El Castillo, which is a restored step-pyramid. There's also a Sacred Cenote nerarby which is walk of around half a kilometre from the pyramid. There are a lot of vendors inside the complex selling all sorts of souvenirs, most of which only accept cash.

{{<figure src="https://i.imgur.com/jAuen6i.jpg" caption="El Castillo at Chichen Itza">}}

Somewhere near the exit, you can find two ATMs dispensing banknotes in US Dollars and Mexican Pesos respectively. This is also where you can buy tickets to cenote Ik-Kil for around 150 MXN. Try to go early, because this is the next stop for tourist buses.

## Day 1: Cenotes Ik-Kil and Lol-Ha
Once you reach cenote ðŸ§­ [Ik-Kil](https://goo.gl/maps/fT5njLmzvWCzjzR17), park your car, get a locker, change, get a life jacket (they are mandatory), take a shower, and head over towards the stairway which leads to the cenote. One of the better things about the rentals at Ik-Kil is that parking, life jackets and locker fees are included in the fee. Honestly, this is the best bang for the buck across all cenotes that we came across. There's a diving pedestal inside the cenote, which is well guarded by lifeguards. Enjoy the blue waters of the cenote for as long as you want. When you're done, you can grab some tacos and beer at the snack bar inside the complex.

{{<figure src="https://i.imgur.com/p9XJ62t.jpg" caption="People enjoying Cenote Ik-Kil">}}

After Ik-Kil, you can head over to the nearby town of ðŸ§­ [PistÃ©](https://goo.gl/maps/ymuEzWPGXjjLcrJX7) to have lunch. For some reason, most restaurants here seem to have a buffet, probably to serve the package tourists that arrive here. After a bit of asking around, you can also find a restaurant which offers a-la-carte. Have lunch, and head over to the nearby town of ðŸ§­ [Yaxuna](https://goo.gl/maps/4tRNuaEqAThG37EUA).

{{<figure src="https://i.imgur.com/ghXPm63.jpg" caption="The clear, aqua-blue waters of Cenote Lol-Ha">}}

This town is home to cenote ðŸ§­ [Lol-Ha](https://goo.gl/maps/DojG4oRCBohvJdpA6). This severely underrated cenote, known for its aqua blue water, is about 25km south of Piste. The road is mostly well made except for some abrupt topes (speed-bumps) and potholes along the way. After the bluish-green waters and touristy crowds at Ik-Kil, you will be pleasantly surprised by the aqua-blue water at Lol-Ha. The entry fee is 100 MXN, life jackets are optional. Keep in mind that there is no network around here. Once you're done, head over to our next stop: Merida.


## Day 2: Merida and Progreso
Check in to your accomodation, freshen up, and head to ðŸ§­ [La Chaya Maya](https://goo.gl/maps/YURSHmVaZa972XV36). They have two branches, but I've heard both serve equally good food. You can then head to the central square and have marquesitas before coming back to rest for the day.

{{<figure src="https://i.imgur.com/YifcN8L.jpg" caption="Merida">}}

The next day, you can refuel your car at one of the PEMEX outlets. The fuel rates vary, but we found a PEMEX outlet with a rate of 19.99 MXN per litre. Surprisingly this was the best rate we could find across our roadtrip. You can then head over to the ðŸ§­ [Mayan World Musuem](https://goo.gl/maps/3AnCaeFKKvoKuscD8), explore around a bit, and then progress towards Progreso. Have brunch at the beach restaurant ðŸ§­ [Almadia](https://goo.gl/maps/3iVXaQFUXdCrNVMQA), and if you feel like, you can just relax by the beach. 

{{<figure src="https://i.imgur.com/TnQnIRA.jpg" caption="Salmon and Oysters at Almadia">}}

You can then head over to the ðŸ§­ [Ecological Reserve of El Corcito](https://goo.gl/maps/wxfAhVUK8VREC9yN7) which is a mangrove swamp that is home to three cenotes. These are shallow ones, so you most likely won't even need a life jacket. When you're done, head over 30km west to see the pink waters and the flamingos of ðŸ§­ [Laguna Rosada](https://goo.gl/maps/fAGhRz9c2L5MCyqW7). You would have had a long day by now. We did too, and by now we totally wished that we had decided to stay the night in Progreso.  

However, we didn't want to take on the hassle of cancellations, so we decided to head back to Merida, where you can have dinner at ðŸ§­ [Picheta](https://goo.gl/maps/1UJvhTuTubVEgScc9). They have rooftop dining which overlooks the ðŸ§­ [Plaza Grande](https://goo.gl/maps/Wm1V9WdXJjQhmFp9A). If you are lucky, you might also get to witness some gathering at the central square, which you can head to after dinner. We arrived here on a Monday and we were told the entry is free. However, the seats get occupied quickly. When you're done, get back home and finish the day with the liquor that you got earlier.



## Day 3: Bacalar
The next day, get up, have breakfast at huevos rancheros. It's a bit outside of the city, so prepare for a detour. We shall now head to Bacalar. On your way, you will encounter street vendors selling coconut water (agua de coco). I personally really like them, so you can try them out. Spend some time at bacalar, and have late lunch at **some hotel** near the port. Their quantity of food is generous, so consider that before ordering. The entry is 30 MXN, which includes parking. If the weather is sunny, try and get a boat ride across the lagoon. We arrived here a bit too late on a Tuesday, and it was cloudy, so we couldn't find enough people for the boat ride. The boat ride is around 300 MXN per person. We then headed to our accomodation, and took a dive in the lagoon. For dinner, head back to the city and visit **some place**. The vibe here is the best of all we could find on this roadtrip. Try to find a seat by the lagoon if you can. It's really beautiful. Spend some time here, and head back home to relax.

{{<figure src="https://i.imgur.com/IdH27TW.jpg" caption="La Playita, Bacalar">}}

## Day 4: Bacalar
The next day, arrange for a sunrise kayak and watch the sunrise in the lagoon. Once you're done, have some breakfast at the hotel, and head to **Los Rapidos**. The entry is reasonable, and life jackets are included in the price. Float around in the clear blue water, and when done, head over to Tulum.

## Day 5: Tulum
The "hotel zone" of Tulum was too crowded for us, so we decided to stay in the city. Keep in mind that for this reason, we didn't go to the hotel zone during our stay at Tulum. You can corroborate this if you pass through the hotel zone on your way to the accomodation. Check in, and head over to explore Tulum City.

You can start with buying some souvenirs. The farther you get from the city centre, the cheaper you get. Make sure to check out the street food which is right behind the main avenue. The churros and marquesitas we had were the best in our entire trip.

{{<figure src="https://i.imgur.com/2kk4xBj.jpg" caption="Tulum">}}

If you stay in the city centre (pueblo) and want to explore the nightlife, you have limited options. You can go to **Batey** which is famous for using sugarcane juice. The vibe was also good here, although it was a bit crowded.

You can also head over to this japanese fusion place, which is a bit expensive but their mezcalitas are pretty strong. Finally, head over to **Santiago** if you are in a mood to dance.

If you have midnight hunger pangs, some to the area next to the pemex station. The guy sells one of the best tacos we had. You should be tired now, so get some rest.

## Day 6: Tulum
The next day, have a lazy morning, and head over to Coba. Keep in mind that you can no longer climb the pyramid over here. On your way back, take a swim in the gran cenote or cenote cavalera. We couldn't go to gran cenote since we were late, but cavalera had a swing and it also had pits from which you can jump into the ground, which is pretty cool. After you're done, head back home and you can then head over to **some local place** followed by Horus to enjoy some hookah. After you're done, head back home to get some rest.

## Day 7: Playa del Carmen
Head over to this lagoon and enjoy snorkelling. We spent quite some time over here. The flow is towards the ocean so keep in mind that going towards the ocean is easier, returning back is hard. Apart from the entry fee, make sure you get the diving set complete with fins, visors, snorkels and life jackets. After spending some time, head over to Playa.

{{<figure src="https://i.imgur.com/7ZqYQGG.jpg" caption="The clear blue waters of Playa del Carmen" >}}

Park your car somewhere (they have metered parking here) and head over to **some place**. The waitress had a good sense of humour and when we ordered two beers, she was like "where's one for me?". We ordered a ton of food here. Their fresh drinks are also nice. I was surprised to find tamarind juice so refreshing.

Once your tummy is full, head over to the accomodation to check in, have some rest, and in the evening, explore the market of playa. You can have hot chocolate at **au cocoa** and then head over to the beer club if you're a fan. The guy over there knows his thing. You can actually sit by the bar and order drinks off the menu as well. Next, you might want to go to one of the nightclubs on fifth avenue. It was a bit too much for me so we skipped it. It has already been a long day and you might actually consider resting for the night.

## Day 8: Cozumel
The next day, wake up to have breakfast, get your covid tests done, and head over to the pier and buy tickets to cozumel. Winjet is 220 MXN per person, whereas Ultramar is 250 MXN plus taxes. The ferry is for 35 minutes. We don't recommend taking your car over there. Upon arriving, you can rent a car from one of the shops around San Miguel Church. There is definitely room for bargain, especially when it's mid day and they still haven't rented a car yet. We got a convertible Beetle. The dashboard said VW96 somewhere, so we're guessing it was made in 1996. This cost us 1000 MXN, plus taxes.

{{<figure src="https://i.imgur.com/T2MIZSe.jpg" caption="That's how our Beetle looked like." >}}

By this time, you know we're a fan of cruising around. So we drove towards Punta Sur, the southernmost part of the island. You can have lunch at Raasta Cafe. It's located right near the entrance to Punta Sur. Make sure to try out their Coco Loco. It's a cocktail served in a coconut!

{{<figure src="https://i.imgur.com/M5ptaSo.jpg" caption="Make sure to try a Coco Loco." >}}

Since you're already at the entrance, you can decide to go into the Punta Sur eco beach park, although we would recommend against it. We weren't able to see any marine life from playa Punta Sur. That being said, the view from the Faro Celarain lighthouse is breathtaking. You can see the blue ocean on one side, and the two lagoons on the other.

{{<figure src="https://i.imgur.com/glMjiQq.jpg" caption="The view from the Faro Celarain lighthouse">}}

Next, continue cruising along the main road towards the north, and enjoy the views. Fuel up, return your car, and head over to the pier to watch the sunset. Take your tickets to the next ferry, and head back to Playa del Carmen. For dinner, you can go to Zenzi and enjoy the food. The restaurant closes at 1am, but you can sit by the beach if you want. Since this would be the last night of the trip, take some time and let the sea sink in.

## Day 9: Cancun
Get up early, watch the sunrise again if you want, have breakfast, pack your bags and check out. Head over to Cancun and spend some time at your favourite restaurant, or drive by the hotel zone. It's surrounded by a lagoon on one side and the ocean on the other. You can stop by the beach to have a marquesita. It should now be time for your flight. Hasta la vista Mexico!
