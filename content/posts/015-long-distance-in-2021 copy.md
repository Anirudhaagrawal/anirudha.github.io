Anushree and I have been in a long-distance relationship for about two years now. We first met in the beginning of January, 2020. Three months later, the nation went into a lockdown -- and so did we. At that time, the virus was still very new to the world and we would only get to know more about it as time progressed. Until then, it was best for everyone, including us, to adhere to the lockdown norms and stay in our homes.

## Love during the pandemic

Though I would agree that the pandemic has been the worst time to pursue love, I feel that in a lot of ways, it has also helped people gauge the depth of their relationships. The pandemic has been a test of time. It has helped separate a partner who lasts for a night from one who might last forever. Something similar happened to me and Anushree. 

She was in medical school during that time, but I had already graduated two years ago. She lived with her parents, while I lived in a rented apartment. None of our parents were comfortable with the idea of having a girlfriend/boyfriend, so we decided to keep our relationship from them (as if the pandemic wasn't enough). 

Despite these hurdles, our relationship progressed pretty quickly. We were already in a relationship in January. By March, we were already planning our future together[^isnt-this-too-soon]. That is when I got an admit to pursue a masters in New York. She already knew about my masters applications since January, and I was aware of her plan to do her residency in the US. Our timelines were very different, though. I had an admit for Fall 2020, and the earliest she could be in the US was Fall 2021. It's so ironical that despite knowing this from the start, we decided to pursue our relationship. It's like signing up for trouble[^signing-up-for-trouble].

[^isnt-this-too-soon]: A lot of people might argue that two months is too soon. But I really feel that there's no right time. Once you click, you click. At that time, like most other times, I decided to trust my gut.
[^signing-up-for-trouble]: You wouldn't be wrong if you said that we brought this onto ourselves. But when you decide to follow your gut, you make irrational choices. And most times emotions can't be rationalised.

Fast forward to July, and I decided to defer my admit to 2021. That was arguably the happiest phase of our lives. She had a harrowing yet rewarding experience during her medical internship, but we would meet each other every few days. But that didn't last long. As a result of my deferral, I had to switch jobs, and possibly move to a different city. By August, I had a new job and in October, I went to visit my parents for over a month. 

## A taste of long-distance

October 2020 was the first time we had ever experienced a long-distance relationship -- just 10 months after we first met. Having previously enjoyed the freedom to talk to my girlfriend freely in my room, I now had to be mindful of my parents. I couldn't talk to her as often, and this was one of the first issues that we faced because of the distance. I wasn't able to get back to her for hours at a stretch. We often talked about how much we missed each other, but that only made things worse. 

It was her way of expressing her love for me, but I used to see the distance as a problem that can only be solved once we meet. I missed her too, but since it was me who went away, I felt that I was respoinsible for the distance and the misery. As you can see, this highlights the different mindsets we had. From my perspective, I hadn't visited my parents since the start of the pandemic so I had a reason to be with them. From her perspective, she was helpless because she couldn't do nothing about it.

> This was one of those moments where I realised that a relationship isn't just about the butterflies in your stomach and the benefits of companionship. It's also about the sinking feeling in your heart and the pain of separation. Most times, having a partner is a source of strength and comfort. You can depend on them. But when you're away from them, things change. You miss them and that's not a happy feeling at all.

I tried to devise my own ways to help it. I wrote her letters which I never sent. I wouldn't say that it helped me a lot, but at least it was something. Thankfully, things changed when I decided to surprise her on her birthday. I fondly remember the moment she saw me. 

She was ecstatic beyond words. As soon as she saw me, she cried out my name in surprise and gave me the tightest hug ever. I could feel the joy and the relief while she was in my arms. I won't lie, but in that moment I felt that the separation was worth it.

A relationship is an emotional roller coaster, indeed. It will make you happy, but it will also make you sad. And when that happens, often times you might question your decision to be in a relationship in the first place. Me and Anushree are fortunate enough to have found each other. I would make sacrifices just to be with her, without giving it a second thought[^sacrifice-without-second-thought]. And I believe this is important to sustain a relationship. 

> Make efforts to remind your partner why they fell in love with you in the first place. When times are hard, this will keep you going.

[^sacrifice-without-second-thought]: I believe this is one question that should provoke an answer instantly without getting you into thinking too much. If you are, you should probably be reconsidering your relationship.
