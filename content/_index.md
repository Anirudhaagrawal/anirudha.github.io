Hi there! I'm a Computer Science Master's student at NYU's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

Before NYU, I was a Deep Learning Engineer at [Flixstock](https://www.flixstock.com/), where I worked on GANs for photorealistic image editing.
Previously, I was a Research Engineer at [IBM Research India](https://research.ibm.com/labs/india/) where I developed novel techniques for conversational question answering with [Danish Contractor](https://sites.google.com/site/danishcontractor1/home) and his team.

I got the opportunity to pursue my bachelor's thesis as a Research Intern at [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) where I worked with [Navin Goyal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/navingo/) on translating code to natural language.

I graduated from [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) with a B.E. (Hons) in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. For more information, feel free to reach out to me using any of the social platforms. _Links are right below that beautiful smile :)_
