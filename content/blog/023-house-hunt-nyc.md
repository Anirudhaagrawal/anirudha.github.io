Finding a house in the most populated city in the US is no easy feat. Imagine doing that at a time when property prices were soaring and it gets even worse. I had the _pleasure_ of searching for a room in New York with a budget of under $1500 at a time when the market was recovering back from super cheap COVID prices. So here's my house hunting experience in the Summer of '22.

But first, a little background. I am a graduate student at NYU so proximity to the university's campus around Washington Square Park in lower Manhattan was a priority for me. My ideal place would get me to Washington Square Park in under 20 minutes. Being a student, I also had a _limited budget_ of $1500 a month. I was looking for a room in an existing apartment, but I was also okay with signing a new lease for a 2BR or a 3BR with my friends. I only needed a place for 6-7 months until my graduation in December but I was happy to sign the lease for a longer term and find a sublet later on. Essentially, I was only constrained by travel time and budget, but was very flexible in terms of the neighbourhood, roommates, diet and all other preferences.

And yes, let me emphasize that $1500 _is_ a limited budget for a private room in lower Manhattan. I started off with a mindset that this would easily get me a comfy private room close to campus, but little did I know that property prices were off the charts. What would get you a private room with private bathroom close to subway stops last year can only get you a _cozy_ room someplace far off. Oh, and 'cozy' is used as a synonym for 'tiny'. That's realty lingo you gotta keep up to.

# Platforms to Find a Place

I started looking for places on Facebook, and some quick googling around introduced me to Craigslist. On the way, I discovered other platforms such as Roomi, SpareRoom, and even Reddit.

Here is a quick summary of websites that I used for my search. The most common problem when rooms are in short supply is the response rate. I believe that at the time of writing this post there is a dearth of sellers and an abundance of buyers which makes the situation so dire.

## Room / Roommates

I only had some luck with [SpareRoom](https://spareroom.com), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/) and [Craigslist](https://www.craigslist.org/). The biggest issue with these websites is the abundance of scam. You will also be disappointed by the terrible response rate. I only heard back from less than 10% of the listings that I contacted on SpareRoom. 

[**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/) is notoriously difficult as its search feature sucks. Don't get me wrong, you can definitely find posts using the search bar on Facebook, but often times you need to do more. Try searching for a term in the most recent posts within a group and I'm sure you'll share my pain.

[**Craigslist**](https://www.craigslist.org/) uses an old clunky UI. Don't be disappointed by it though, the website is quite functional. It's a mixed bag though. The posts which are legitimate and elaborate often times do not respond. The ones which are short can sometimes be legitimate. But something that I've seen a 100% of the time is that the posts which are too good to be true are definitely scams.

[**SpareRoom**](https://spareroom.com) and some of the other room finding websites also have a lot of posts from representatives of services like [JuneHomes](https://junehomes.com/), [AYA Rooms](https://helloaya.com/), [Roomrs](https://www.roomrs.co/) and [Bungalow](https://bungalow.com/). It gets even more annoying when these websites do not use the correct pin. I often clicked on map markers in Manhattan and the listing turned out to be in Brooklyn or somewhere else.

[**Roomi**](https://roomiapp.com) had my hopes up with advertisements all across the NYC subway. However, I didn't hear back from my top options. In fact, I hardly heard back at all! 

[**Roommates**](https://roommates.com/) is full of scams. I get new message requests a few hours after I log in, but most (all?) of them turn out to be scams. It's easy to smell them after a while.

## Entire Apartments

[Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/) and [Streeteasy](https://streeteasy.com/) are the obvious choice here. [Apartments.com](https://www.apartments.com/) falls in the same category. These websites are a good option if you're looking for entire apartments. The agents are much more responsive here, but beware of the broker fee. It usually turns out ot be 15% of the annual rent, which is 1.8 months' rent. That's ridiculous! If you're on a budget, this is not for you.

What you can try instead is to contact the property management company directly. Often times there are no broker fees involved. I saw a few apartments from [MetroNest](https://metronest.com/) which were close to what I wanted. I will also advise you not to shy away from contacting one of the "luxury buildings". I got in touch with [Herald Towers](https://heraldtowers.com/) and to my surprise they had a 3 bed flex arrangement that was close to my budget. For more information, I shall point you to [transparentcity.co's blog](https://www.transparentcity.co/blog/10-great-websites-of-no-fee-management-companies-nyc) for more such property management companies.

**A Mix of Both**

[Craigslist](https://craigslist.org) seems to be very popular with the locals. However, here again I didn't hear back from any of the legitimate properties that I was interested in. The ones that replied back turned out to be scams asking for a deposit before showing around.

[Facebook Marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/) is another interesting option. Take care of the groups that you join though. A lot of them are full of scams but a few of them also have legitimate listings. The easiest way of separating the wheat from the chaff is to look for the _address_ and the _rent_. Often times scammers also ask you to _send me a screenshot of the post_.

# Facebook Groups

Facebook and Roommates.com has a lot of spam.

Some of the best deals are also found on facebook

Join gypsy housing. Also join the listings project. I have had better response rates with the listings project.

Manhattan is prohibitively expensive. The rooms are small. They may not be well lit.

Brokers in new york charge a 15% fee. That's 15% of the annual rent. That's 1.8 months' rent. That's ridiculous.

# Beware of Scams

The first lesson I learnt is that all platforms are filled with scams. The key here is to trust your gut. If you think something is too good to be true, _it sure is_. Often times you will be asked to sign a lease or send a deposit and the person on the other side will promise you to _mail in_ the keys. That's NOT gonna happen. They are going to appeal to the emotional side of you and make some silly excuses. Here are some of the reasons I've come across.

* The landlord is caught up in an emergency situation (such as an accident).
* This is a tenant occupied unit and the landlord respects their privacy.
* The landlord is out of town and will mail in the keys once you make a deposit.

Often times the landlord will be very assertive in their tone. Do NOT fall for it.

> As a thumb rule, ALWAYS view the apartment in person before moving forward.

Do NOT make any deposits before viewing the apartment in person. No exceptions. This rule applies equally to listings from Facebook, Craigslist, Roomi, and all the other sites.

## Red Flags

Here are a few red flags to look for when you're scouring through listings to find your next home. Please take this with a heap of salt though. One or two red flags might be okay, but if you see a lot of them, you should definitely be cautious and act accordingly.

1. The post seems generic and does not have details about the address and the rent. You are asked to reply back with a "screenshot" of the post. 

If you were a scammer and you're posting the same listing with the same photos on multiple platforms across multiple locations, what would you do?

2. You get a quick response asking about your email / phone number so the conversation could be taken off the platform.
3. You are being coerced into making a quick decision about "securing your position" by paying a deposit even before you have seen the place.



# Preferred Areas

East Village had the most affordable listings, but all of them were railway style apartments in older walk-ups.
