If you've ever known me, you would have noticed that I'm a person with idiosyncracies. Sometimes, these can get overwhelming. I do identify with having a mild OCD with most things. My daily life is full of examples. Take this blog for instance. I could have chosen a theme for my blog. One of the many templates that are available online. But I decided to create one myself. If you've ever texted with me, you'll find me obsessing over the proper use of punctuations. I use legal full names while saving contacts. I am obsessive about little things. The good part is that things look organised. The bad part is that all of this has a cost.

# The tradeoff is real

Until mow I used to consider this quality of mine as an advantage. I would be happy that I would never produce work which I don't approve of. My project reports would be spot on. They would have the best template which fits figures on the same page. The paragraphs would end with no line unutilized. Everything would look super organized and well polished. I have been living such a life so far. I have been focusing on the aesthetics. Probably more than I need to. 

Sometimes these compulsions get in the way of things. It starts off as a casual desire to correct that skewed laundry bag lying at the corner of your room. It ends with, well, it never ends. The cost of such compulsion is time. It may not be very significant depending on the life that you're living. But I'm sure there might be some part of your lives that was fast paced. Where you needed to make decisions quickly. It is these tiems where you start to quesiton your choices of perfection. 

I hate to say this, but this really is a problem. I mean, everybody wants an organised home, an organised shelf, an organized everything. But sadly if one keeps on focusing on organizing stuff, when will you actually focus on doing stuff? Many times it makes sense to consider the trade off. You would be tempted to read the whole book instead of just a few pages from the book. But is it worth spending that much time?

The sad part is that these questions do not have specific answers. You might think it's worth spending that extra time decorating your mid term report. But you would forget that what matters more is the content of that report. The font does not matter. It doesn't matter whether you spent 4 hours writing that report in Word or if you spend 4 days writing the same in LaTeX. I used to think that the additional effort is worth the payouff. But in my experience, I have cone to the conclusion that there are many more things that you potentially miss out on. 

# So what next?

I'm sure you must have come across the phrase "prioritizing". In a nutshell, it means focusing on the most important things right now, and postponing the rest for later. I have known this for a long time now. I'm sure you must have known this too. But what's hard is to implement this stuff. Espectially when you're so used to being perfect. You don't want to abandaon that side project that you've been working on just because you have a deadline at work. You don't want to stop building that table lamp just because you have an exam tomorrow. But that's so not worth it. Your grades on the exam will dictate your future. The fact that you made a table lamp will only give you immediate gratification.

Here you might ask another question. WHy chosse a path which does not have enough gratification? The reasons are simple. This is again about what your priorities are. You do aim to achieve things in life. And so you have dreams and aspirations. But at the same time you also have this compulsive desire of perfection. Like most things, excess of everything is harmful. I feel like perfectionism is the same.
